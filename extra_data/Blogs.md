title: OK, so ChatGPT just debugged my code. For real
date: 2023-10-05 01:58:55
tags: tech

Not only can ChatGPT write code, it can read code. On the one hand, that’s very helpful. On the other hand, that’s truly 
terrifying.

<a href="https://imgur.com/MtYXUQn"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MtYXUQn.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Programming is a constant game of mental Jenga: one line of code stacked upon another, building a tower of code you hope 
is robust enough not to come crashing down.

But it always does, as code never works the first time it’s run. So, one of the key skills for any programmer is 
debugging — the art and science of finding why code isn’t running or is doing something unexpected or undesirable.

It’s a little like being a detective, finding clues, and then finding out what those clues are trying to tell you. It’s 
very frustrating and very satisfying, sometimes at exactly the same time.

I do a lot of debugging. It’s not just because code never works the first time it’s run. It’s also because I use the 
debugging to tell me how the code is running, and then tweak it along the way.

But while good debugging does require its own special set of skills, it’s also ultimately just programming. Once you 
find out why a block of code isn’t working, you have to figure out how to write something that does work.

Real-world ChatGPT testing

This week, I was working on three coding tasks for software that I maintain. Two were fixes for bugs reported by users. 
One was a new piece of code to add a new feature. This was real, run-of-the-mill programming work for me. It was part of 
my regular work schedule.

I’m telling you that, because up until now, I’ve tested ChatGPT with test code. I’ve made up scenarios to see how well 
ChatGPT would work. This time, it was different. I was trying to get real work done, and decided to see if ChatGPT could 
be a useful tool to get that work done.

 

It’s a different way to look at ChatGPT. Test scenarios are often a bit contrived and simplistic. Real-world coding is 
actually about pulling another customer support ticket off the stack and working through what made the user’s experience 
go south.

So, with that, let’s look at those tasks and see how ChatGPT performed.

 

Rewriting regular expression code

In coding, we have to find a lot of patterns in text. To do so, we use a form of symbolic math called regular 
expressions. I have been writing regular expressions for decades, and I still dislike doing so. It’s tedious, 
error-prone, and arcane.

So, when a bug report came in telling me that a part of my code was only allowing integers when it should be allowing 
for dollars and cents (in other words, some number of digits, possibly followed by a period, and then if there was a 
period, followed by two more digits), I knew I’d need to use regular expression coding.

 

Since I find that process tedious and annoying, I decided to ask ChatGPT for help. Here’s what I asked:

# Cybersecurity Awareness: The Python Packages Malware Threat

## Beware: Python's Garden of Digital Serpents

In today's digital world, it's not just about the snakes in the grass; it's the snakes in your computer we need to worry about. We're talking about a cyber threat that's as cunning as it is dangerous – hundreds of malicious Python packages slithering through the web, stealing sensitive data. Let's delve into this digital pit of vipers and understand what's at stake.

![python](https://i.imgur.com/97j4Ho0.png "python")



### The Stealthy Strike of Python Packages

These aren't your garden-variety malware. They're sneaky, sophisticated, and they've got a taste for sensitive data. Disguised as harmless Python packages, these cyber serpents have been lurking in the shadows of open-source platforms, waiting to strike. And strike they have, with about 75,000 downloads, each one a potential disaster.

### The Venom: What Are They After?

These digital snakes are after everything that makes your digital life tick:

- **Antivirus Secrets**: They're after the antivirus tools running on your device, looking for weaknesses.
- **Personal Data**: From Wi-Fi passwords to your favorite browser's history, they want it all.
- **Cryptocurrency**: They're eyeing your digital wallets, hoping to make a quick crypto-heist.
- **Gaming Accounts**: Yes, even your Minecraft and Roblox data isn't safe.
- **Social Engineering**: They harvest data from platforms like Discord to manipulate and exploit.

### The Evolution of the Threat

This isn't a static threat. Like any good predator, it evolves. From plain text malware in April to multi-layered obfuscation by August, these cyber serpents are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. They're even learning to turn off antivirus products. It's a digital arms race, and they're not backing down.

### The Defence: Vigilance and Awareness

The key to defending against this threat is vigilance. The cybersecurity community, especially open-source communities, need to be on high alert. It's crucial to scrutinize projects and package publishers and to stay vigilant against typosquatting (maliciously misspelled package names). Remember, in the world of cybersecurity, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

## Staying One Step Ahead

This cyber threat is a wake-up call for all of us. In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, staying informed is not just a choice, it's a necessity. As we continue to rely on digital solutions, let's not forget the importance of cybersecurity. After all, it's not just about protecting data; it's about protecting our way of life.

Stay safe, stay aware, and let's keep the digital snakes at bay.---

# Altering our Language: A Comedic Take on Chatting with Chatbots 🤖

Hey there, fellow human (or am I assuming too much?)! Let's talk about something that's been bugging me lately. You know those large language models, like ChatGPT? Yeah, those incredibly smart, sometimes eerily human-like chatbots. Well, guess what? Some brainy folks at Imperial College London just tossed a paper into the academic ring, published in Nature, no less, suggesting we might need to tweak how we jabber with these digital geniuses. 🧠

<a href="https://imgur.com/vcdFWSA"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vcdFWSA.jpg" title="TDC" /></a>

## Chatting with a Bot: It's Not Just Small Talk Anymore!

These chatbots, powered by neural network-based large language models (LLMs), can make you feel like you're texting your bestie instead of a bunch of code. It's like they've taken a crash course in human charm! But here's the kicker: our brains, those squishy, sociable organs, get tricked into thinking we're having a heart-to-heart with another human.

### Why This Could Be a Problem (Hint: It's Not Just Awkward Conversations)

Imagine this: you're chatting away, and suddenly, you're sharing your deepest secrets or, worse, your bank details (because who wouldn't trust a friendly chatbot, right?). Enter the potential for scammers and propagandists. They could use these LLMs to play on our inherent need for connection, leading us down some not-so-rosy paths.

<a href="https://imgur.com/fN6m9Bx"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fN6m9Bx.jpg" title="source: TDC" /></a>

## The Grand Solution: Time to Rethink our Chatbot Chatter

Professor Murray Shanahan and his team suggest we stop making these LLMs sound like our long-lost siblings. You know, phrases like "ChatGPT totally gets me," or "It's like it's reading my mind!" Nope. According to these brainiacs, this anthropomorphizing (fancy word for making things human-like) makes our social brains go overboard.

### The Game Plan: Metaphors and More Metaphors

The team proposes two metaphors. First up, think of AI chatbots as actors in a one-character play. They're just playing a part, folks! Next, for those who like a twist, view them as cosmic gamblers, betting on roles in a multiverse of characters. Trippy, right?

Professor Shanahan says, "Don't get hung up on one metaphor. Dance between them!" (Okay, maybe he didn't say 'dance,' but I like to imagine he did.)

<a href="https://imgur.com/ueWuZzv"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ueWuZzv.jpg" title="source: shrugs" /></a>

## In Conclusion: Let's Keep it Light!

So, next time you're typing away to your favorite chatbot, remember: it's not your BFF, your therapist, or your dog. It's a super-smart, role-playing, universe-jumping piece of code. And hey, that's pretty cool in its own right!

What do you think? Ready to change how you chat with chatbots? Drop a comment and let's start a (very human) conversation!

# Area 51: A Nexus of Alien Conspiracy Theories

## Introduction
Area 51, the enigmatic military base in Nevada, has been a magnet for conspiracy theories for decades. Despite being visible on satellite images, it's a place shrouded in secrecy, adding to its allure.

## The Root of the Theories
Theories range from **alien experiments** to **staged moon landings**. The site was historically so secretive that it was absent from public U.S. government maps.

## Historical Background
- **Project Oxcart**: In the 1950s and 1960s, Area 51 was home to this top-secret Cold War-era program. Its aim was to develop spy planes like the A-12, capable of traveling over 2,000 miles per hour.
- **Aerial Gunner Training**: During World War II, the site was used as an aerial gunnery range.
- **U-2 and A-12 Development**: Selected by the CIA for testing high altitude reconnaissance aircraft, leading to innovations like the U-2 and the A-12.

## Public Speculation and UFO Sightings
The advanced aircraft tested at Area 51 often resembled UFOs, fueling public speculation and numerous UFO sightings. This, combined with the site's secrecy, has perpetuated the alien conspiracy theories.

## The CIA's Acknowledgment
In 2013, the CIA released declassified documents acknowledging Area 51's existence and detailing the U-2 and Oxcart programs. This was a significant moment in the base's history, but it didn't fully quell the public's fascination with extraterrestrial theories.

## Conclusion
While Area 51's history is rich with advanced aerial testing and development, the combination of secrecy and human curiosity has allowed alien experiment conspiracy theories to flourish, creating a narrative that continues to captivate imaginations worldwide.

# The Snowpiercer and Willy Wonka Connection: A Delectable Theory

<a href="https://cojovi.com/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UcaBJcm.png" title="source: cojovi.com" /></a>

## **Introduction**

Welcome to a world where chocolate rivers flow into icy dystopian landscapes. Today, we unravel the theory that "Snowpiercer" is not just a stand-alone post-apocalyptic tale, but a sequel to the whimsical "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory." Sounds like a fantasy, but could there be a golden ticket of truth here?

## **The Wonka-Wilford Transformation**

Imagine young Charlie Bucket, the heart of "Willy Wonka," evolving into Wilford, the enigmatic creator of the Snowpiercer. It's a transformation from a candy-filled dream to a frost-bitten reality. The theory, proposed by Rhino Stew, suggests that after inheriting Wonka's empire, Charlie (now Wilford) used his newfound knowledge and resources to respond to a global crisis, thus creating the Snowpiercer.

### **Connecting Characters**

- **Gilliam = Mr. Wilkinson/Slugworth:** This theory plays on the idea of deception and loyalty. In "Willy Wonka," Slugworth is a façade, a test of character for the golden ticket winners. Similarly, Gilliam in "Snowpiercer" is a spy and a pivotal character in maintaining order and balance on the train, mirroring Slugworth's role in Wonka's world.
- **Minister Mason = Veruca Salt:** Post-garbage chute trauma, Veruca Salt transforms into Minister Mason. The theory suggests that her near-death experience left her deeply indebted and loyal to Wilford/Charlie, thus explaining her authoritative, slightly unhinged demeanor in "Snowpiercer."

### **The Oompa Loompa Enigma**

A crucial element of Willy Wonka's factory, the Oompa Loompas, are absent in "Snowpiercer." The theory suggests their extinction, leading to Wilford's use of children for maintenance tasks in the train. It's a dark twist, reflecting the harsh realities of survival in the new world.

## **Themes and Parallels**

Both films explore class struggles, destiny, and sacrifice. The journey through the fantastical structures in both movies - the chocolate factory and the train - serves as a metaphor for societal structures and the trials one must overcome. The endgame in both? Finding a worthy successor to carry on a legacy.

## **Conclusion**

While this theory is a banquet of imaginative connections, it's essential to take it with a pinch of salt (or a dash of cocoa). The parallels are intriguing, and the character transformations are fascinating to ponder, but at its core, this theory is a testament to the power of storytelling and the endless possibilities it holds.

## Dana White demands Peloton bikes removed from UFC gym over past conflict with comedian Theo Von  Ffff you, Peloton ##

# **Dana White's Pedal-Powered Protest at UFC**

## **No More Peloton Rides at UFC Performance Institute**

UFC's head honcho, Dana White, has just laid down the law: It's goodbye to Peloton bikes at the UFC Performance Institute. This drastic move comes after a comedic twist involving Theo Von and a controversial podcast episode.

![Dana White](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hIOnUkAl4goVy0kbpN7zJX0aQbA=/1400x1050/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25089425/1744596275.jpg)

### **The Peloton Problem**

Here's the scoop: Theo Von, a comedian and podcast host, was sponsored by Peloton. But trouble brewed when Peloton got twitchy over an episode featuring Robert Kennedy Jr. Dana White's reaction? A no-holds-barred verbal takedown of Peloton and their CEO, Barry McCarthy.

> "So Peloton, what do they sell? **Freakin' stationary bikes?**" - Dana White

### **The Great Peloton Purge**

Dana didn't just stop at fiery words. He called in Craig Borsari, UFC’s EVP of Ops, and made it clear:

> "We’re getting rid of the Pelotons. Pelotons are out of the gym. That’s what you do. You stop using their products."

This isn't Dana's first rodeo with corporate clashes. He recalled a time a major sponsor tried to censor his political support and got a similar treatment.

[Dont miss the video i clipped of the greatest part!! ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5oC9iYn6bI)

### **The Aftermath**

Fast forward to the present: UFC's gym is now a Peloton-free zone. And Barry McCarthy? Well, he's probably rethinking that statement about everyone wanting to partner with Peloton, especially after Dana's fiery retort:

> "You sell stationary bikes, you clown. That guy is the typical pompous, arrogant jerk that I cannot stomach." - Dana White

### **Peloton's Rocky Road**

Peloton's journey isn't all smooth riding. They've hit a financial snag, with a hefty net loss and a plummeting stock price. Despite recent partnerships with the NBA and WNBA, Dana White's UFC has made it clear: They're not fans.

**Dont be fooled by fake accounts, How to Find out if who your messaging is real or not!**

So this lil story has a little backing to it.  This woman started texting me on Facebook messenger, of course first thing I did was check her profile.  SHOCKER, she didnt have a Facebook profile she just had messenger.  Of course I asked her about it and there were the excuses, blah blah.  At this particular time in my timeline, I was in florida working, and I was out there alone, so having somebody to bullshit with wasn’t a bad thing.  I was sure the person was fake, but didnt really pry.  Long story short, chatted with her/him/it for a few weeks then lost interest. She recently started hitting me up again and now that I had a little more leisurely time on my hands I figured I would solve this damn puzzle.  So I started off with, “hey lets video chat” … excuse excuse excuse…. So now its grind time.

\*\*Backstory, when I was in florida she lived in florida, months later now she live in New Jersey, and she works at a Orphanage  (cmon now)\*\*

She would always call me “babe” (not sure why) so I started what I call the “bait questions” , in order to bait them into a reply or something in which im trying ti place them.  So I asked if she likes movies, of course she answered yes.  Then joked around about like most girls im sure she can never pick a movie, she agreed.  

That was the setup, I recent found a pretty cool website that helps couples pick a movie, haven’t used it yet but was very intrigued.  The man picks a movie and the girl picks one and it finds one with the likeness of both blah blah blah, thats not the point. The point is im trying to setup a legitimate reason to get her in my playing field… Ill explain

For those who dont know, there is a process called “IP logging” or “URL IP Logging” and its very simple.  What it does is this

Im sure everybody has seen “url shortening links” like when you see a google link that looks like [goo.gl](http://goo.gl).hdye748 or something of that nature, thats just google shortening the link for whatever reason, aesthetics or whatever.  Well now you can do that same process but also embed a code in that newly made URL that will track whoever clicks its IP address.

The Process:

1.  You pick a website (a real website) , remember should be something intriguing that will make sure they click it
2.  Goto any IP Logging URL shortener
3.  Plug in the Bait url and this is Very important, when its shortening the url it’ll give you options as to what the “disguised url” will come out as, now you can just makeup whatever you want you have to look at which ones they offer, thats why I chose the URL for the movie thing , because one of the disguised URLs they offered was [dating.club](http://dating.club), I felt that was hidden enough not to second guess it
4.  After you made your link, keep on with your story.  Paste the link and wait for your logger to tell you the info.

So long story short, here is the OUTCOME!

A semiconductor research company, SemiAnalysis, has reported that Google's upcoming generative AI tool, Gemini, is currently five times more powerful than the most advanced GPT-4 models on the market. The company predicts that Gemini could be as much as 20 times more powerful than ChatGPT by the end of 2024.

![](http://techdonecheap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/unnamed-47.jpeg?w=1024)

SemiAnalysis's report comes after Google appeared to be lagging behind other tech giants in the development of generative AI tools. However, the company has recently made significant investments in AI, and the release of Gemini is seen as a sign that Google is now taking the lead in this area.

The Center for AI Safety, a research group that studies the potential risks of artificial intelligence, said that Google's investment in Gemini is "no surprise" given the company's "tremendous financial resources." The center also warned that the spread of generative AI could pose a threat to human life, and that it is important to develop safety measures to mitigate these risks.

The development of generative AI has also prompted governments to take action. China has made moves to regulate its AI businesses, while the British government is to host an "AI safety summit" in November. The United States Senate is also planning to host a series of meetings on AI safety, with the first meeting scheduled for September 13.

The development of generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of this technology. By working together, governments, businesses, and researchers can help to ensure that generative AI is used for good.

This guide will show you how to crack [pre-shared key](https://techofide.com/blogs/how-to-use-aircrack-ng-aircrack-ng-tutorial-practical-demonstration/#psk) [WPA/WPA2](https://techofide.com/blogs/how-to-use-aircrack-ng-aircrack-ng-tutorial-practical-demonstration/#wepwap) networks using the Aircrack-ng tool, which is used to crack wifi passwords. We are going to discuss what are pre-shared keys, what is packet injection, then we will verify if your Network Interface Card (NIC) supports packet injection. Then we will go ahead and crack the WAP/WAP2 wireless network.

At the end of this blog, I have also included a video of the [Aircrack-ng Tutorial](https://techofide.com/blogs/how-to-use-aircrack-ng-aircrack-ng-tutorial-practical-demonstration/#tut) for your ease that will show you how to hack wifi in real life.

**_Note:_** _We're only teaching you for educational purposes and to broaden your horizons. Because we know that both ethical and non-ethical hackers use these tools, Techofide will not be held liable for any unlawful/false actions you engage in._

**Methodology of WiFi Hacking**

WiFi hacking approach takes place in five simple steps

1.  The first stage involves configuring the WiFi adapter to set it in monitor mode also called promiscuous mode, with this mode enabled the wifi adapter can capture packets that might or might not be aimed at them.
2.  The second stage is gathering information on nearby access points. Information such as MAC address, Channel number, Authentication type, and clients/stations connected to a specific access point.
3.  The third stage is to de-authenticate a client connected to a specific access point so we can capture a four-way handshake. For this step, we need the MAC address of the client and the access point. We can also perform several other types of attack at this stage such as Fragmentation attack, MAC-spoofing, Man-In-The-Middle attack, Evil twin attack or a dos attack to disable the AP.
4.  In the fourth stage we finally capture the four-way handshake, this step involves a bit of patience. You may not capture a handshake right away so all you need to do is wait.
5.  In the final stage, we run a brute force attack against the captured handshake. This is a resource-intensive task and the time is taken may wary depending on the wordlist and CPU speed.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiquW1VW-38hTgI_oWQQf8UcWkNaGDB7aZTdQsU7One1Go7kHLNiwnp-Omr3QZkSHgGKTXsv6GFdqEYBhYn1O5l82Qd5c2BhyU-nFdxPRGXQq6WK8xxdW6yu-oWc8HjZOMerirwkcLOAYl7bI_Muy19_lUmVKnKRd53JG8QFBYGWOi9y8CAhvqso1I7ww/w418-h112/2.webp)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiquW1VW-38hTgI_oWQQf8UcWkNaGDB7aZTdQsU7One1Go7kHLNiwnp-Omr3QZkSHgGKTXsv6GFdqEYBhYn1O5l82Qd5c2BhyU-nFdxPRGXQq6WK8xxdW6yu-oWc8HjZOMerirwkcLOAYl7bI_Muy19_lUmVKnKRd53JG8QFBYGWOi9y8CAhvqso1I7ww/s677/2.webp)

Now let's see how the methodology is used in a real-world attack scenario with the help of the diagram given below.

1.  The attacker first configures his/her own network interface card. That is the network interface card is set to monitor mode and can perform packet injection.
2.  Then the properly configured network interface card is used to perform a de-authentication attack.
3.  The de-authenticated client then reconnects to the access point.
4.  This allows us to capture the four-way handshake.
5.  We then perform a brute-force attack or a dictionary attack on the captured handshake.
6.  Once the attack is completed we have the decrypted password.

**Basic Terminologies**

Before we actually start cracking the wifi password it's good to know a few terms that are useful to understand this blog and practical.

**WEP VS WAP/WAP2**

WEP and WAP/WAP2 are security protocols that are used to secure your wireless communication. Sometimes you may see access points as **open** it just means they are not using any security protocols.

**WEP:** Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an acronym for Wired Equivalent Privacy. Different encryption tools used to secure your wireless connection are known as WEP and WAP. The least secure of these protocols is WEP.

**WAP/WAP2:** Wireless Protected Access (WPA) is an acronym for Wireless Protected Access. The WPA2 standard is the second iteration of the WPA protocol. The most secure of the three is WPA2. There is no difference between breaching WPA and WPA2 networks when it comes to breaking them. The authentication procedure is nearly identical. As a result, you'll use the identical techniques.

**WAP3:** WAP3 stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 and is the Wi-Fi Alliance's third version of a security certification programme. WPA3 is the most recent and improved version of WPA2.

You can confirm that the security protocol in use is WPA/WPA2 as shown in the above image

**What is Pre-Shared Key(PSK)?**

Protected Wi-Fi Access WPA-PSK, or Wi-Fi Protected Access, is an encryption technique that is used to authenticate users on wireless local area networks. A pre-shared key is essentially a shared secret or password that is used to verify someone's identity when they join a wireless network. WPA2-PSK or WPA Personal are other names for WPA-PSK. In addition to pre-shared keys, WPA/WPA2 provides a variety of authentication procedures.

**What is Sniffing?**

Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all requests and data packets passing through a given network. Active Sniffing and Passive Sniffing are two types of sniffing.

**What is Packet Injection?**

Packet injection (also known as forging packets or spoofing packets) is a technique used in computer networking to interfere with an established network connection by creating packets that appear to be part of the normal communication stream. Packet injections are mostly utilized in Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, which we shall do during the deauthentication phase.

**What is Network Interface Card (NIC)?**

We can use wifi thanks to a network interface card. A network interface card is a piece of hardware that allows the computer to communicate with other computers across a network. It is a hardware component that is installed in a computer and enables a dedicated network connection to the machine. To see your NIC details, type the command below.

**Note:** My NIC is labeled as wlp1s0, yours may be different.

iwconfig

**What is Aircrack-ng?**

Aircrack-ng is a comprehensive set of tools for evaluating the security of WiFi networks. It focuses on various aspects of WiFi security, including:

*   **Monitoring:** Packet capture and data export to text files for additional processing by third-party tools
*   **Attacking:** Packet injection attacks include replay attacks, de-authentication, and the creation of bogus access points, among other things.
*   **Testing:** Checking the capabilities of WiFi cards and drivers (capture and injection)
*   **Cracking:** WEP and WPA PSK Cracking (WPA 1 and 2)

The tools are all command-line-based, allowing for a lot of scripting. A great variety of graphical user interfaces have made advantage of this feature. It is available for Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and even eComStation 2.

We will be using the airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng, and Aircrack-ng tools from the Aircrack-ng suite. Let's look at their usage.

**Airmon-ng: Monitor Mode**

Airmon-ng is used to manage wireless extensions modes. To sniff a wireless connection, you must switch your wireless card from **managed** to **monitor** mode, which is done with airmon-ng. Monitor mode allows your card to listen in on all packets in the air. Normally, only packets intended for you will be "heard" by your card. We can later capture the WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake by listening to every packet.

**Airodump-ng: Authentication Handshake**

Airodump-ng is a wireless sniffer that can collect data from several wireless Access Points. It's used to look for nearby Access Points and record handshakes.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2d2dwuGNdizRXR9jcwPYgGMubtIstkVr-O8FcT1eBHNYRZSc8BONsotfSswbx4EQaA36F_3rkPbGvwhvWkD01UMSKGAUjv085zhcMSUamo_zlbTPXSbtrXOugd88SFtE4CMIGxRb5TO6lrfljYh3quyI9iTzDqsLQxgdMYvpuiK28Qz-39Cl56VNd1Q/s320/tempsnip3.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2d2dwuGNdizRXR9jcwPYgGMubtIstkVr-O8FcT1eBHNYRZSc8BONsotfSswbx4EQaA36F_3rkPbGvwhvWkD01UMSKGAUjv085zhcMSUamo_zlbTPXSbtrXOugd88SFtE4CMIGxRb5TO6lrfljYh3quyI9iTzDqsLQxgdMYvpuiK28Qz-39Cl56VNd1Q/s1122/tempsnip3.png)

**Aireplay-ng: Deauthenticate Client**

Aireplay-ng is a replay attack and packet injector tool. Users can be de-authenticated from their APs in order to collect handshakes. This step is only required if you've decided to speed up the process. Another constraint is that the AP must be connected to a wireless client at this time. If no wireless client is currently connected to the AP, you must be patient and wait for one to connect before capturing a handshake. You can go back and repeat this step if a wireless client arises later and airodump-ng fails to capture the handshake.

**Aircrack-ng**

In order to find the key, Aircrack-ng is used to attack WPA/WAP2 wireless protocols. For cracking the password Aircrack-ng uses brute force attack against the captured handshake. The drawback of using Aircrack-ng to brute force is that it utilizes CPU instead of GPU which makes the attack slow.

**Aircrack-ng Download and Install**

The Aircrack-ng suite is pre-installed on most security-focused distributions. However. if you're using a non-security distribution like Ubuntu or Mint, type the command below.

**Ubuntu or Mint**

sudo apt install aircrack-ng #installs aircrack-ng suite

**How to use Aircrack-ng?**

Now that we have learned everything that needs to do practical, let's actually crack the wifi password.

**Step 1:** To get rid of any conflicting process type the following command. Make sure to type this command otherwise it may cause problems later.

sudo airmon-ng check kill

**Step 2:** Next start the wireless card aka WLAN in monitor mode, by using the following command:

\[This step refers to the **Configuring NIC** stage as aforementioned\]

sudo airmon-ng start wlp1s0

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjx3wnQSzoDXmhF4p816JPYo8oOLRdky9YR5gCa_gGyv20bKOh7oc-mnxyLHb1G2GrVOBiVBUP6zIWZdQMHk-Dt3S4NOOFYQzXVyKSiPHkIwHJZcMxgpcOJFvaenSvZIvaNaAZiDS9Ol45mu103NwXoDLpv45EwCFPOyMmHWgYjv-9xxISvrz3WUHVBqw/s320/tempsnip7.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjx3wnQSzoDXmhF4p816JPYo8oOLRdky9YR5gCa_gGyv20bKOh7oc-mnxyLHb1G2GrVOBiVBUP6zIWZdQMHk-Dt3S4NOOFYQzXVyKSiPHkIwHJZcMxgpcOJFvaenSvZIvaNaAZiDS9Ol45mu103NwXoDLpv45EwCFPOyMmHWgYjv-9xxISvrz3WUHVBqw/s1049/tempsnip7.png)

You'll see that **wlp1s0** has been set to monitor mode in the above image.

**Step 3:** Enter **iwconfig** to verify that the interface is properly configured.

**Note:** Notice the interface name has changed from **wlp1s0** to **wlp1s0mon**.

iwconfig

You can see that **wlp1s0mon** is in **monitor** mode. It's critical to double-check all of this information before moving on; otherwise, the next stages will fail.

**Step 4:** This is a simple test to see if your card is capable of supporting injection. Type the following command.

**Note:** Sometimes it may say Found 0 AP, which could mean that you are not physically close to the AP or the signal strength is weak.

sudo aireplay-ng --test wlp1s0mon

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicOBb5jtHD46jdnGODYzKlwOOXH045t2GjfIDJ0soz97qCbtM7zz62F_1Jmow_Yk7m9rJlLts_YoMQV_ZWQifM7VPELvhpO8mGYjRNKit5NH9k-eSK3IgpUf3Sr28JFYruzvbJWEyugsMc0Q-InM4CBDSFsgQuP7yPHvruX7J_1VOT6jbbTTd6bs19Cw/s320/tempsnip9.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicOBb5jtHD46jdnGODYzKlwOOXH045t2GjfIDJ0soz97qCbtM7zz62F_1Jmow_Yk7m9rJlLts_YoMQV_ZWQifM7VPELvhpO8mGYjRNKit5NH9k-eSK3IgpUf3Sr28JFYruzvbJWEyugsMc0Q-InM4CBDSFsgQuP7yPHvruX7J_1VOT6jbbTTd6bs19Cw/s775/tempsnip9.png)

Analysis of the response:

*   **22:42:58 Found 1 AP**: The broadcast probes or received beacons were used to locate these access points (APs).
*   **22:42:58 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 - channel: 11 - 'Druid'**: Notice that this AP is on channel 11.
*   **22:43:04 0/30: 0%** for Druid: This is the only AP with which the card can communicate effectively. This is a different type of verification that your card can perform.

**Note:** Essid's are the names of the access points and Bssid is the MAC addresses associated with them.

**Step 5:** Now, We will use Airodump-ng to capture the traffic and 4-way authentication handshake for the target Access Point we're interested in. Enter the following command.

\[This step refers to the **Gathering remote wifi information** and **capture handshake** stage as mentioned before\]

sudo airodump-ng wlp1s0mon

There are several options available in this command such as -d which creates a filter removing jitters.

**Note:** You can also send this information to Wireshark for static analysis by specifying a filename with the -w option.

When a wireless client is joined to the network, it appears like this:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_Qdgb7rNIcTeCgtE58x6KxcYDLZmJmcCQhmliM7mBzj6e96JtyIWJyOR6WPZUYiEiLxXeFL6s6rv_80OSbCJVxEhq9YjZ0zryjrJt03cjp2h8Xq0jWJC9gOuN1BpCTXQPjFXSxOhFCfuIFMT-YAa4RGXQBHTYizRWHs4n7jdPhiq9FScbFnuWzzkPYA/s320/tempsnip10_Por3qgd.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_Qdgb7rNIcTeCgtE58x6KxcYDLZmJmcCQhmliM7mBzj6e96JtyIWJyOR6WPZUYiEiLxXeFL6s6rv_80OSbCJVxEhq9YjZ0zryjrJt03cjp2h8Xq0jWJC9gOuN1BpCTXQPjFXSxOhFCfuIFMT-YAa4RGXQBHTYizRWHs4n7jdPhiq9FScbFnuWzzkPYA/s1100/tempsnip10_Por3qgd.png)

Notice the **WPA handshake: 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06** in the top right-hand corner of the screen above. This signifies that the four-way handshake has been successfully collected by airodump-ng. You can also use tcpdump for the same. Also notice that in the Notes section we can see **EAPOL** which stands for **Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) over LAN** and it's a type of message sent by the access point to the station.

Here it is with no handshakes are found:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgm11X0BuELTl9E-lOvcqmwgInWgPh3uyAnaQ6kM30nP7jSsqzXsJ5JAWrAwi87lpIfW-2a2kaLb4lDJcJTyjoLiSD1SKfaa5weSEf-_4TtWkDYZJr_czsCQCY3vlHBMp90BtF1zEO3yUxCfJCzfCl5TCby_WH9SZlj1A2poGaNq_J-ENZmYHi3kBLtaQ/s320/tempsnip11.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgm11X0BuELTl9E-lOvcqmwgInWgPh3uyAnaQ6kM30nP7jSsqzXsJ5JAWrAwi87lpIfW-2a2kaLb4lDJcJTyjoLiSD1SKfaa5weSEf-_4TtWkDYZJr_czsCQCY3vlHBMp90BtF1zEO3yUxCfJCzfCl5TCby_WH9SZlj1A2poGaNq_J-ENZmYHi3kBLtaQ/s1053/tempsnip11.png)

**Step 6:** Use Aireplay-ng to de-authenticate the client.

\[This step refers to **de-auth any connected user** stage as mentioned before\]

This phase notifies the wireless client devices that it is no longer connected to the access point. Hopefully, the wireless client will then reauthenticate with the AP. The 4-way authentication handshake we're interested in gathering is generated by the reauthentication. We utilize this to crack the WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key.

You determined which client is currently connected based on the output of airodump-ng in the previous step (04:C8:07:15:71:C0). For the following, you'll need the MAC address. Open a new terminal and type:

**aireplay**\-ng --deauth 0 -a 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 -c 04:C8:07:15:71:C0 wlp1s0mon

Where:

*   \--deauth means send deauthentication beacon.
*   0 is the number of deauths to send (0 means infinite)
*   \-a 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 is the MAC address of the access point
*   \-c 04:C8:07:15:71:C0 is the client's MAC address, this is optional but sending directed deauth is better
*   wlp1s0mon is the interface name

**Step 7:** Run Aircrack-ng to crack the pre-shared key. You'll need a dictionary of words as input for this. Aircrack-ng basically takes each word and checks to see if it is the pre-shared key. The rockyou.txt file, which contains a list of common passwords, can be downloaded [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwih8czX_oP1AhX7UGwGHfZMAXcQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrannondorsey%2Fnaive-hashcat%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fdata%2Frockyou.txt&usg=AOvVaw3snAERl1mU6Ccr4WFEazBd).

\[This step refers to **brute force captured packet** stage as mentioned before\]

**Note:** If you are using a security OS such as Kali or Parrot Security, you can find the wordlist in /usr/share/wordlists directory.

Open up a new terminal and type:

sudo aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b 84:D8:1B:06:EF:06 psk\*.cap

Where:

*   \-w rockyou.txt is the name of the dictionary file. If the file isn't in the same directory, make sure to specify the full path.
*   \*.cap is just the name of a set of files that contains the packets that were captured. Notice how we utilized the wildcard \* to include many files in this situation.

When no handshakes are identified, the following is typical output:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLeaISIbg9KHH_PQwTT6LtHE3iR9vxjWWf8NKENMl6yM4B6sEMr27yzCDANde5D5GjU48rdiK64MY5E4SotbyrEJnhBCX8ebpia2ZE5NnC39FzAOwIU7Lk3JF8fj_Ic5pYjCy7CUJSchAdpAHdM6gsv4e2wEMsVGfXcwq8w140BzGhFXp6Tl81dYHgiA/s320/screenshot_20211229_121033.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLeaISIbg9KHH_PQwTT6LtHE3iR9vxjWWf8NKENMl6yM4B6sEMr27yzCDANde5D5GjU48rdiK64MY5E4SotbyrEJnhBCX8ebpia2ZE5NnC39FzAOwIU7Lk3JF8fj_Ic5pYjCy7CUJSchAdpAHdM6gsv4e2wEMsVGfXcwq8w140BzGhFXp6Tl81dYHgiA/s1268/screenshot_20211229_121033.png)

If this occurs, you must repeat step 6 (de-authenticating the wireless client) or wait longer if you are utilizing the passive option.

At this point, Aircrack-ng will attempt to decrypt the pre-shared key. This could take a long time, even days, depending on the speed of your CPU and the size of the dictionary.

The following is an example of successfully cracking the code:

Election Security: A Rollercoaster of Drama and Suspense

In a world where binge-watching political dramas is the norm, the real-life twists and turns of election security are giving those TV shows a run for their money. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has recently sent out a nationwide memo to secretaries of state, warning of "extremely alarming" threats. It seems our next election might have more suspense than the season finale of your favorite series.

Since the nail-biting 2020 presidential showdown between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, election security has catapulted from a subplot to the main storyline. The saga, with its cliffhanger that took days to resolve in Biden's favor, spawned a series of lawsuits faster than you can say "recount." Some conservatives, led by Trump, didn't just cry over spilled ballots—they claimed the whole milk carton was rotten, leading to the infamous Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

Now, in a plot twist no one saw coming (or did we?), Trump is waiting in the wings, facing a criminal trial after being indicted on four counts for allegedly attempting to script his own ending to the 2020 election saga. The charges read like the back of a blockbuster movie cover: conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and obstruct an official proceeding.

But wait, there's more! Last August, Trump and his ensemble cast of 18 others were indicted by a Georgia grand jury for their alleged roles in trying to overturn the state's 2020 results. The Republican front-runner for the 2024 nomination, in a move that shocked absolutely no one, pleaded not guilty to all charges.

According to Timothy Langan, the FBI's equivalent of a leading man in the Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch, "The threat environment, unfortunately, is very high." He delivered this line at the winter conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Washington, making everyone wish they had popped some popcorn before the meeting started.

As we brace ourselves for the next episode in this ongoing political thriller, one thing is clear: the path to the 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be anything but boring. With the stakes higher than ever, our nation's secretaries of state are on the front lines, armed with nothing but their wits and an unwavering commitment to democracy. 

So, grab your favorite snack and settle in. This is one show you won't want to miss. And remember, unlike TV dramas, the outcome of this story affects us all. Let's make sure we play our part by staying informed, engaged, and ready to vote. Because in the end, the future of our democracy is not just in the hands of those who lead us but in the actions of every voter.

Newsweek attempted to reach out to the FBI for a sneak peek into the next season, but at the time of writing, our emails remain as unanswered as the questions surrounding the next election. Stay tuned, folks. The drama is just getting started.

**Setting Up Your Oobabooga Chatbot:** A Rollercoaster of Text Generation and Hilarity 🎢 Hey there, tech aficionados and chatbot enthusiasts! Are you ready to dive into the world of text generation and chatbots? Buckle up, because we're about to set up a chatbot using RunPod's Oobabooga Text Generation WebUI template. And let me tell you, it's easier than explaining to your grandma how to use emojis. 😂

**The Starting Line 🏁** First things first, head over to RunPod and create a pod using the "RunPod Text Generation UI" template. It's like choosing your starter Pokémon, but with fewer fire hazards. Once you've summoned your pod into existence, you'll be able to connect to the text generation server on port 7860. Just click on "Connect" and then "Connect via HTTP \[Port 7860\]." Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

![](http://techdonecheap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/download-4.png?w=318)

**The Control Room 🎛️** You'll land on a page that looks like a minimalist's dream. You'll see tabs like "Text generation" and a textbox that screams, "Type something, you genius!" Below that, you'll find some buttons and drop-downs that are preset to the Pygmalion model. Oh, and speaking of Pygmalion, it's an unfiltered chat model, so it might occasionally spit out something NSFW. You've been warned, you cheeky rascal!

**Basic Training 🏋️‍♀️** The Pygmalion model is like that friend who's good at parties but needs a bit of context to shine. You can use it right out of the box, but if you want to spice things up, you can load a more "characterful" character from the "Character gallery" extension at the bottom. Just click on the triangle to expand it, and voila! You'll see example characters like "Chiharu Yamada." Click on the picture, and you're good to go!

![](http://techdonecheap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/download.jpeg?w=318)

**Let's Chat! 💬** Once you've picked your character, you'll see some text appear in the chatbox. It's like the model is saying, "Hey, how you doin'?" You can reply by typing into the "Input" textbox. Use asterisks for actions (e.g., "I do a backflip.") and regular text for speech. Hit "Generate," and the model will respond as your chosen character. If the model's reply is as awkward as a first date, just hit "Regenerate" to give it another shot.

**Buttons, Buttons, Buttons 🖲️** You'll see buttons like "Impersonate," "Remove Last," and "Clear History." They're pretty self-explanatory, but if you're feeling adventurous, go ahead and click 'em! It's like playing with a new toy, but without the choking hazard.

![](http://techdonecheap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/download-5.png?w=351)

**The Character Tab 🎭** If you're the nosy type and want to see what makes your character tick, click on the "Character" tab. You'll see a profile that tells the model who it's supposed to be. It's like a dating profile but less cringey.

# Deployment Platforms: The GGood, The Bad, and the Techie

Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts! Today, we're diving deep into the world of deployment platforms. We've got four heavy hitters in our lineup: Vercel.app, Netlify, Digital Ocean, and Heroku. Let's break them down, weigh their pros and cons, and figure out which one could be the champion of your deployment needs.

<a href="https://techdonecheap.com"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sQOzZvu.png" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

## Vercel.app - The Sleek Speedster

<a href="https://techdonecheap.com"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f1WZdnq.png" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

- **Serverless Functions:** Offers out-of-the-box support for serverless functions, making it a go-to for modern web applications.
- **Preview Environments:** Every git push gives you a live preview environment, which is super handy for testing.

### Cons:
- **Pricing Can Be Tricky:** While it offers a generous free tier, costs can escalate quickly as your project scales.

### Cons:
- **Performance Issues:** For larger, more complex sites, you might notice some lag in build times.
- **Limited Server-Side Capabilities:** Like Vercel, it's more frontend-focused.

## Digital Ocean - The Robust Powerhouse

- **Maintenance Overhead:** You'll need to manage and maintain your servers, which can be a hassle.

## Heroku - The Trusty All-Rounder

<a href="https://techdonecheap.com/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FlAZU2g.png" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

### Pros:

- **Add-on Ecosystem:** A vast array of add-ons for databases, monitoring, and more.
- **Language Support:** Supports a wide range of programming languages.
- **Free Tier:** Great for small projects and hobbyists.

### Cons:
- **Sleep Mode:** On the free tier, your app sleeps after 30 mins of inactivity, which isn't ideal for always-on services.
- **Scaling Costs:** Costs can escalate significantly as you scale up.

## Conclusion - The Ultimate Choice

If I had to pick a winner, it’s like choosing my favorite child! But, at the end of the day, I'd lean towards **Digital Ocean**. Its combination of control, scalability, and robust product offerings makes it a versatile choice for a range of projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting your feet wet, Digital Ocean provides a solid balance of power and flexibility. 

That's a wrap, folks! Remember, the best platform for you depends on your specific needs and skills. Happy deploying!

The journey of making a motorized TV mount, after I saw something on an old episode of MTV cribs, I tried to make my own version with garage parts…. 

![Winking](http://127.0.0.1:49614/rw_common/plugins/blog/smiley_wink.png)

I saw a show where the main character had a tv that was hidden behind a dresser, and when he pressed his remote it would appear from behind it, I thought it was so cool! After looking online to see how much it was I was astonished at the price they were charging, so what now? Time to Build it!!

I started with the test build, pretty much just building it for functionality, wont be pretty, but it needs to work. The first iteration of this was built with scrap 1x2’s, some metal gear/wheels I found in my garage and some belts for said gears.

![](https://techdonecheap.files.wordpress.com/2023/04/cleanshot-2022-11-22-at-00.41.31.gif?w=418)

After the first iteration worked, I notated what I wanted to do for the final product and that consisted of

Make it less noisy, I used an old RC car motor to power it, it did work, but was a bit louder then id like

Program the compatibility for Alexa/Google Home

After long hours of getting those completed, I was left with exactly what I wanted

## This is the final product!!!

Happy with the outcome!

## Iterations - 2  
Money Spent - $47  
Happiness Level - 1000000

I was chit chatting with my brother and he was telling me a story about the Photo Booth he had rented for his daughters birthday party, how much fun they had, and how much everybody loved it.  His mind, as always, will begin thinking, could this be made lucrative?  he mentioned how much the rental was, i forget what that figure was now, but if i were to guess, probably around the $500 range for a full evening..?  but in order to purchase a machine yourself i think he said around $1,800, ive also looked up a couple myself and see the anywhere from $1,800-$3,600.

So of course this would promt me to turn the gears in my bring to devise a cheaper alternative, being a tech, gadget, programmer, and raspberry pi addict, knew it would be done for pennies on the dollar. So i started with Github, of course.

i knew i had all the parts needed, so it wasnt that big of a process. 3 hours later, i had a completed adapt of a Photo Booth!  of course i didnt care enough to build the whole "booth" part, although if for some reason, i found a wild up my arse, that wouldnt be an issue either, i would just be driving myself crazy for a few days deciding how i would want to design it.  but anywhoo.....

The Raspberry Pi is the heart of the booth,

currently the photos are being snapped with a PiCam, which can be switched for damn near any ofther camera with the proper programming modifications.  but i feel the PiCam Is not only adequate for this but maybe ever over powered.

Ive got 2 basic/analog push buttons, running through a breadboard.  The two button control the main features of the booth.  Blue Button starts the picture taking process (after you choose if you want to take 1 or 4) and the red button (after pics are taken) will send the image to your local wifi enabled printer to autoatically print

Rust is a modern systems programming language that is quickly gaining popularity among developers. It is designed to be safe, fast, and expressive, making it a good choice for a variety of applications. Rust is also open source and has a large and active community, which means that there is plenty of support available if you run into any problems.

![](http://techdonecheap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/introduction-to-rust-programming-language_art-board-1.jpg?w=723)

So, why should you learn Rust? Here are a few reasons:

*   **Rust is safe.** Rust has a number of features that make it safe to use, such as ownership and borrowing. Ownership ensures that no references to a piece of data are left dangling, and borrowing prevents data from being overwritten. This makes Rust less prone to errors than other languages, such as C++.
*   **Rust is fast.** Rust is a compiled language, which means that it is fast. It is also designed to be efficient, and the compiler will optimize your code for performance.
*   **Rust is expressive.** Rust has a rich type system and a number of features that make it easy to write expressive code. For example, Rust has pattern matching, which allows you to match values against a set of patterns. This can be used to write code that is more concise and readable.
*   **Rust has a large and active community.** Rust is an open source language, and there is a large and active community of developers who are using and contributing to the language. This means that there is plenty of support available if you run into any problems.

If you are a systems programmer, or if you are interested in learning a modern systems programming language, then Rust is a great option. It is safe, fast, expressive, and has a large and active community.

### Rust for beginners

If you are new to Rust, there are a number of resources available to help you get started. The official Rust website has a great [getting started guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html) that will teach you the basics of the language. There are also a number of online courses and tutorials available, such as [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/rust).

Once you have learned the basics of Rust, you can start to build your own projects. There are a number of great resources available to help you find projects to work on, such as [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/awesome-rust) and [Rust-Beginners](https://github.com/rust-beginners/rust-beginners).

Rust is a powerful language that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. If you are looking for a modern systems programming language that is safe, fast, and expressive, then Rust is a great option.

# **Mark Zuckerberg's $100M Hawaiian Hideaway: Bunker Included**

Ah, **Mark Zuckerberg**, our favorite hoodie-clad billionaire and part-time internet overlord, has been making waves – not just on the internet but in the picturesque landscapes of Hawaii. Reports say he's building a $100 million compound with a massive underground bunker. Why? Well, let's dive in like we're infiltrating a secret Facebook group.

<a href="https://imgur.com/sPsenOV"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sPsenOV.jpg" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

## 1. **The "Why" Behind Zuck's Hawaiian Fortress**
First off, why Hawaii? Because when you're worth billions, why not? Hawaii is like the group chat everyone wants to be in – exclusive and picturesque. But why a compound? Maybe Zuck's taking FarmVille to a whole new level, or perhaps he's just really into Lilo & Stitch.

Now, about that underground bunker. We can speculate a few reasons:
- **Privacy, Please:** It's no secret that Zuck values privacy (for himself, at least).
- **The Superhero Lair Theory:** Maybe he's crafting a superhero identity. Iron Man started in a cave, after all.
- **Zombie Apocalypse Prep:** Because why not? If you have billions, preparing for the undead is a weekend hobby.

<a href="https://imgur.com/igRfnrK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/igRfnrK.png" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

## 2. **The Elite’s Escapade: Are Others Doing the Same?**
Zuckerberg isn't alone in his quest for luxurious isolation. It's like a VIP club for the ultra-rich.
- **Billionaire Bunkers:** It's a trend! Other elites are reportedly building fancy hideouts. Think of it as an upgrade from backyard treehouses.
- **Escaping the Spotlight:** Maybe they're just tired of paparazzi and want a break from being absurdly wealthy in public.

## 3. **What's He Hiding? – Apart from His Browser History**
Is Zuck hiding something? Besides his browser history, we can only guess:
- **Alien Communication Center:** Just kidding. Or are we?
- **Time Machine Project:** To go back and reinvent the 'poke' feature, perhaps.
- **A Secret Lab:** Where the only experiment is finding a way to wear something other than a gray T-shirt.

## 4. **The Compound Itself: Cribs, Billionaire Edition**
Let's talk about the compound. We're expecting:
- **Smart Everything:** Lights, doors, and even the plants are probably Wi-Fi enabled.
- **Eco-Friendly Features:** Maybe a nod to sustainability, because even billionaires think green (in more ways than one).
- **A Garage Full of Not-Your-Average Cars:** Because when you have a compound, you can't just park a Prius there.

<a href="https://imgur.com/1zjFkuK"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1zjFkuK.png" title="source: techdonecheap.com" /></a>

## 5. **The Local Impact: Not Everyone's Clicking 'Like'**
Not everyone in Hawaii is throwing shakas about this. There's concern about:
- **Land and Culture:** Hawaii has a rich cultural history, and there's a fine line between being a resident and an invader.
- **The Neighborhood Vibe:** Imagine telling your neighbors, "Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg lives next door and he's built an underground lair."

## 6. **The Future of Billionaire Bunkers**
What does this trend mean for the future?
- **Rich Guy Race to Space:** First underground, then Mars? Elon Musk might have competition.
- **Luxury Apocalypse Prepping:** It's like regular prepping, but with champagne and caviar.

## 7. **In Conclusion: The Zuck Bunker Mystery**
In the end, Mark Zuckerberg's $100M Hawaiian compound is a mix of mystery, intrigue, and a dash of Silicon Valley eccentricity. Whether it's for privacy, security, or just a really extravagant way to play Minecraft in real life, one thing is certain: when you're a billionaire, the world is your oyster, and apparently, Hawaii is your pearl.

As we await more details, we'll be here, refreshing our feeds and wondering what's next in the billionaire bunker saga. Will it be a trendsetter or just another quirky billionaire move? Only time (and probably a few leaked documents) will tell.
